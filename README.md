# Spencer Cloud's Neovim Config

I'm uploading this mostly for my own purposes in keeping my Neovim config consistent across machines. It's mostly based off of [nvim-kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/).

If you want to fork this for your own purposes, go ahead, but you'd be better off forking from nvim-kickstart instead.
